# The React Quiz App

![React Quiz App](quiz_app_screenshot.png)

The React Quiz App is a single-page quiz application focused on testing your knowledge of React. The app comes equipped with various functionalities, including a progress bar, a timer, a score tracker, and a display of the previous highest score. The quiz questions are sourced from a `questions.json` file located in the `./data` directory. To fetch the quiz data, the app utilizes json-server, which serves as a mock server.

## Tech Stack

- React
- json-server (for serving quiz data)
- CSS (for styling)

## Quiz Data

The quiz questions are sourced from a `questions.json` file located in the `./data` directory. The `json-server` package is used to serve the quiz data, enabling the app to fetch questions from the mock server.

The `questions.json` file follows a specific format with each question having an ID, the question itself, an array of options, and the correct answer. For example:

```json
[
  {
    "question": "Which is the most popular JavaScript framework?",
    "options": ["Angular", "React", "Svelte", "Vue"],
    "correctOption": 1,
    "points": 10
  }
  // Additional questions...
]
```

Feel free to modify the `questions.json` file to include more questions or customize the quiz content.
